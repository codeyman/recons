This project is far from complete. Use at your own peril

The goal is to create a reentrant wrapper that caches the object files/executables
generated by the compilation of a huge project and then avoid recompilation by even when
make clean is done. 
The idea is to cache the objects in some place and then just copy them over when needed.
